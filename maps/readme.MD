# What's in here?

A bunch of shapefiles used to to a points-in-a-polygon spatial analysis of traffic stops in census tracts. Also in overall visualizations. Some shape files were used for exploratory analysis but not included in the overall stories.

* `buffer10` - The 10 percent edge of a town polygon
* `buffer10` - The 50 percent edge of a town polygon
* `buffer10` - The 60 percent edge of a town polygon
* `buffer80` - The 80 percent edge of a town polygon
* `census_tracts` - Census tracts from the Census
* `ctgeo` - Town borders
* `cut50` - Polygon of towns shrunk 50 percent
* `cut60` - Polygon of towns shrunk 60 percent
* `cut80` - Polygon of towns shrunk 20 percent
* `towns_accurate` - Better shape of town borders with accurate shore line
* `towns_shoreline` - Shoreline shape of the edge of Connecticut
* `tracts_to_towns.csv` - Relationship file between tract number (FIPS code) and town name
