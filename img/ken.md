Met with all the police chiefs to present our findings

that was a private meeting because we give them
we walk them through the analysis

so we're not 

the week of the 25th...

waiting from judiciary and public committee

will release fulla ctual report

not jsut analysis fo 2nd year of data

but also the follow up from year 1

so the follow-up

identified to all the departments, tried to drill down, latitude and logntidue

we did a whole narrative

still finalizing those narratives

we dont actually includea  bunch of maps

because it's a paper report...

---

i think it'll complement whatever we do very well

we talk about how we map the stops

we talk a lot about 

census tracts
stops within census tracts

how we talk about it

tract looks like this, what's in the census tract

mall school, main road cutting through it

what we saw when we mapped the data

we dont put out what we saw because 

static maps are hard to read

so the short version is

if you wanted to start thinking about 

writing or presenting any of this info, through the 

as long as you're willing to hold off

some time next week when we're feeling more confident

i can send you an embargoed copy of the report

if you're interested in it

so we can csee how each coordinates each town

tuesady or wednesday of next week

a draft

---

corridor analysis...
