## Data

#### Some of the data is too large to be listed in this repo, but can be downloaded elsewhere
* Stops between October 2014 and September 2015 - [CT Data Collaborative](http://ctrp3.ctdata.org/rawdata/)

## Scripts

* `bubble_chart_maker.R` - Converts department-level summaries into a json array for a highcharts connected-scatterplot visualization
* `location_prep.R` - Brings in data from an Excel sheet that includes latitude and longitude data for traffic stops from 8 departments. Creates `mega.csv` 
* `town_borders_location_analysis.R` - Some exploratory maps looking at location-specific traffic stops along borders of towns
* `officers.R` - Run after `towns.R`. Adds officer-level analysis and adds it to the department-level summary to create `mega_df.csv`.
* `official_data_merging.R` - Creates `ccsu_data.csv` from various spreadsheets of figures calculated by CCSU's Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy, such as coefficients and k means values.
* `overall_analysis.R` - Script that creates a couple bar charts exploring overall stops by day of week and hour of the day
* `points.R` - Generates [exploratory chart](http://trendct.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/60/files/2016/05/disp_points2-copy-771x411.png) of disparity points based on `mega_df.csv` 
* `scatter_maker.R` - Writes three javascript arrays that created scatter plots used in [this story](http://trafficstops.trendct.org/story/digging-deeper-into-racial-disparities-in-ct-traffic-stops/)
* `time.R` - Testing chart visualization of Veil of Darkness data using Hamden locations
* `time_all.R` - Adds columns determining if a stop happened in sunlight or darkness, adds time of sunrise, sunset, dusk, dawn, and adds other date-specific info to help chart later on
* `time_version_a.R` - Same as above but for 2013-2014 data instead of 2014-2015.
* `towns.R` - Run before `officers.R`. Create a town-level analysis dataframe (`mega_town_df11.csv`), brings in `ccsu_data.csv` to replace calculations with CCSU's "official" figures.

### Images

* `img` folder inlcudes many generated exploratory charts, some of which was used in final stories

### Maps

* `maps` folder includes shape files used to generate choropleths in the walkthroughs and scriopts
